# Prompt History Record

## Prompt
```
/sp.tasks but please too much concised
```

## Response
```
Successfully generated comprehensive tasks for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA). The tasks.md file includes:

Phase 1: Setup and Foundation (T007-T010): Initial directory structure and navigation setup.

Phase 2: Foundational Implementation (T011-T014): Base navigation, styling, and sidebar configuration.

Phase 3: [US1] Voice-to-Action Pipelines Chapter (T015-T023): For AI students familiar with ROS 2 to understand voice processing and OpenAI Whisper integration.

Phase 4: [US2] LLM-Based Cognitive Planning Chapter (T024-T032): For robotics students to understand natural language processing and action planning.

Phase 5: [US3] VLA Execution with ROS 2 Chapter (T033-T041): For human-robot interaction students to understand ROS 2 integration and action coordination.

Phase 6: [US4] Educator Support (T042-T046): Quality assurance and instructional consistency.

Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T047-T056): Final improvements, cross-references, and validation.

All 56 tasks follow the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels where appropriate, and clear file paths. Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified. The implementation strategy supports MVP delivery starting with setup and the first user story.
```

## Outcome
Successfully created a comprehensive task breakdown for the Vision-Language-Action educational module with 56 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story and implementation phase.

## Evaluation
The tasks were generated following all required specifications:
- Tasks follow the strict checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
- Organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
- Include dependencies section showing story completion order
- Provide parallel execution examples per story
- Implementation strategy supports MVP and incremental delivery
- All tasks are specific enough to be executed without additional context
- Tasks align with the feature specification and implementation plan
- Ready for implementation phase
